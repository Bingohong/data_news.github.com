### 2017_data_news_competition_works_dydata
The repository introduces how to **visualize geographic data** in _the 2017 data news competition_.
The theme of competition is **Chinese folk custom** which is one of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage items.
So don't be strange about the data and diagram.
I apply two methods to implement the **spatial visualization**,including:
1. [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/):The matplotlib basemap toolkit is a library for plotting 2D data on maps in Python
2. [Mapbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapbox):Mapbox is a large provider of custom online maps for websites
